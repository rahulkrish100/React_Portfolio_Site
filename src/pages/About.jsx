            I'm a developer with a strong analytical background, applied to
            building clean, functional web applications. I enjoy reasoning
            from first principles when designing software &mdash; starting
            from a clear problem statement and building up to a working,
            well-tested solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of formal coursework, I maintain an interest in UI
            design, applied problem-solving, and open-source tooling. I'm
            currently focused on strengthening my front-end engineering
            skills, particularly with React and modern deployment
            workflows.
